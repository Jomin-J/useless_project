# No Purpose Search Engine - Next.js Project

This is a Next.js-based parody search engine that mimics the look and feel of a real search engine but provides completely useless, sarcastic, and philosophical responses instead of helpful results.

## Project Goals
- Create a professional-looking search interface similar to Google using Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Implement humorous and philosophical responses instead of real search results
- Include interactive elements like loading animations and easter eggs
- Maintain a balance between looking legitimate and being obviously satirical

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14+** with App Router
- **React 18+** for component-based UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** (not TypeScript for simplicity)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use Next.js App Router structure with the src/ directory
- Implement React functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Write clean, well-commented JavaScript
- Focus on user experience and smooth animations
- Include easter eggs and hidden interactions for entertainment

## Key Features to Implement
- Realistic search interface with loading animations
- Sarcastic/philosophical response database
- "I'm Feeling Confused" button for extra uselessness
- Easter eggs (konami code, special search terms)
- Console jokes and interactions
- Mobile-responsive design using Tailwind
- Server-side rendering capabilities of Next.js

## File Structure Guidelines
- Main page: `src/app/page.js`
- Components: `src/components/`
- Styles: Use Tailwind classes, custom CSS in globals.css if needed
- Utilities: `src/lib/` or `src/utils/`
- API routes (if needed): `src/app/api/`

## Development Approach
- Use React state management for search functionality
- Implement client-side interactions with useEffect and useState
- Leverage Next.js optimizations for performance
- Use Tailwind's responsive classes for mobile-first design
- Consider adding subtle animations with Tailwind's transition classes
